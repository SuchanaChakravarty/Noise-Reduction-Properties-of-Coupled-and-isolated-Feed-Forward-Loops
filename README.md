# Noise-Reduction-Properties-of-Coupled-and-isolated-Feed-Forward-Loops
The codes can be useful to reproduce the results of the research article 'Systematic Analysis of Noise Reduction Properties of Coupled and isolated Feed-Forward Loops'.
For our research we have performed the simulations, for 12 different isolated FFls, 4 linear chain models, 33 different multi input coupled FFl models and 26 different multi intermediate coupled FFl models
As a total, We have total 75 differnt models. 
This classifications are based on possible logic gates - fully AND, fully OR, top-AND-lower-OR (tAND-lOR) and top-OR-lower-AND (tOR-lAND). 
We have also investigated the two steps post translation modifictaion, for few of our models. 
For the validation of our findings, we have tested some of the models, at different parameter regime. This can be achieved by simply changing the parameter values in the main text code for the indicated models.  
The codes are written in text files and can be reproduced in kaemika tools (github.com/luca-cardelli/KaemikaXM).
