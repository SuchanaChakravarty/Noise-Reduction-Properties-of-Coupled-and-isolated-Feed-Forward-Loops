# Noise-Reduction-Properties-of-Coupled-and-isolated-Feed-Forward-Loops
The codes can be useful to reproduce the results of the research article 'Systematic Analysis of Noise Reduction Properties of Coupled and isolated Feed-Forward Loops'
We have total 47 differnt models. 
The codes are written in text files and can be reproduced in kaemika tools (github.com/luca-cardelli/KaemikaXM).
